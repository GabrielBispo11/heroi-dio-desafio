# Dio Challenge - RPG Game (heroes)

In this challenge at Bootcamp GFT Start #3 .NET, knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# was reinforced. For this, an RPG game was used as a context to develop in the user the ability to abstract and solidify the four main pillars of OOP, namely: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism. 

As a suggestion of [Felipe Aguiar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-aguiar-047/) another object was also created to compose the game, in this case the creation of the character Topapa.
